# Final Project Feedback



## Requirements:

You’ll be graded on the following areas:

1. (1/3%) **Technology** - Implementing more technologies (Core Data, camera, location, web services, animations, sounds, SceneKit, HealthKit, CocoaPods, camera, location manager etc). The more the better. Since each app is different try to implement at least 3 major mobile technologies. If you’re unsure, ask!
2. (1/3%) **Creative** - The design of the user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and general creativity of the app, the idea and the implementation. Go to [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create) for color scheme ideas.
3. (1/3%) **Originality** - How original is the idea, and the implementation. This is subjective, but if your app reproduces other apps, this will likely result in a lower grade for this area. Example: A restaurant finder is not very original, but a Boise restaurant finder for college students, with a bus schedule, may be more original. Also, the implementation of the app matters. 
4. **5 minute presentation** 15 point penalty for missing this requirement.
